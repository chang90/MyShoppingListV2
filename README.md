## An React-native apk project

MyShoppingList is an android app project which can help people to reduce food waste and help them to save money on food shopping.

I am trying to rebuild my old shopping list project, because I want to have a huge UX improvement, but the old project is unable to support it.

The [original project](https://github.com/hiby90hou/MyShoppingList) was no longer maintained and I also lost my old github account due to Google Authentication error.
